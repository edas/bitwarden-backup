# Bitwarden Backup

A Rust program to backup your Bitwarden vault data. 

It leaves the data encrypted and never requires your master password. It's only as a backup in case you or the admin of your bitwarden server messes something. If ever, you will have to manually decrypt everything with the help of your master password.

This program is generated by AI. It "works for me" but won't endorse anything.

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be created in `target/release/bitwarden-backup`

## Running the Program

```bash
./target/release/bitwarden-backup --config=config.yaml ./backup
```

### Arguments

- `--config=<FILE>`: Path to the configuration file (required)
- `<DIR>`: Directory path where to export the data (required)

## Configuration File

Create a YAML file (e.g., `config.yaml`) with the following structure:

```yaml
email: "your.email@example.com"
api_url: "https://api.bitwarden.com"
identity_url: "https://identity.bitwarden.com"
client_id: "your_client_id"
client_secret: "your_client_secret"
scope: "api"
grant_type: "client_credentials"
device_type: "21"
device_identifier: "b86dd6ab-4265-4ddf-a7f1-eb28d5677f33"
device_name: "firefox"
```

Most users are in the .com server but you may be in the .eu server if you did opt in for it. You will have a login error if you choose the wrong one.

You can get an API key (client id and secret) by following the documentation on https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/. It should avoid you to leave your master password in clear somewhere. With the API key you can download the profil and the encrypted vault, but nothing more. 

### Configuration Fields

- `email`: Your Bitwarden account email
- `api_url`: Bitwarden API server URL, probably "https://api.bitwarden.com" or "https://api.bitwarden.eu"
- `identity_url`: Bitwarden Identity server URL, probably "https://identity.bitwarden.com" or "https://identity.bitwarden.eu"
- `client_id`: Your Bitwarden client ID, from an API KEY request. Documentation https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/
- `client_secret`: Your Bitwarden client secret, from an API KEY request. Documentation https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/
- `scope`: API scope (usually "api")
- `grant_type`: OAuth grant type (usually "client_credentials")
- `device_type`: Device type identifier (put "21")
- `device_identifier`: Unique identifier for your device (put "b86dd6ab-4265-4ddf-a7f1-eb28d5677f33")
- `device_name`: Name of your device (put "firefox")


## Output Files

The program will create the following files in the specified output directory:

1. `bitwarden.{email}.prelogin.json`: Response from the prelogin request to the identity server
2. `bitwarden.{email}.token.json`: OAuth token response
3. `bitwarden.{email}.profile.json`: Your Bitwarden account profile data
4. `bitwarden.{email}.sync.json`: Your Bitwarden vault sync data

Each file contains the raw JSON response from the respective API endpoint.

## Example

```bash
# Create a backup directory
mkdir -p ./backup

# Run the program
./target/release/bitwarden-backup --config=config.yaml ./backup
```

This will create files like:
```
./backup/
  ├── bitwarden.your.email@example.com.prelogin2.json
  ├── bitwarden.your.email@example.com.token.json
  ├── bitwarden.your.email@example.com.profile.json
  └── bitwarden.your.email@example.com.sync.json
```
